//42.Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

function show_magicians(magicians: string[]){
    magicians.forEach(name => console.log(name));
}

//function to make magician great through .map()will modify array
function make_great(magicians:string[]){
return magicians.map(name =>`The Great ${name}`);
}

//define array of magicians names 
let magician_names =["usama","hamza","ali"];

// call make _ great function to modify magicians nmes 
let great_magicians= make_great(magician_names);


show_magicians(great_magicians)
